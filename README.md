## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to bring awareness to the dire situation in the Mayan jungle. The Mayan biodiversity is being severely threatened by ecocide, and the construction of the train project will only add to the existing damage. The purpose of this project is to showcase the harmful effects that the completion of the train project will have on the Mayan jungle. By raising awareness of this issue, I hope to encourage action to protect and preserve Mayan biodiversity for future generations.

## Why is the Yucatán Peninsula so important?
<ul>
     <li>The Yucatán Peninsula is a large peninsula in southeastern Mexico, located between the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. It is home to a variety of cultures and ecosystems, including tropical rainforests, mangroves, and coral reefs. The peninsula is also known for its rich history, with an ancient Mayan civilization and numerous archaeological sites, as well as colonial cities.</li><br>
     <li>It is also the site of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event 65 million years ago (Chicxulub Impact Crater, n.d.). The Chicxulub crater formed many cenotes. The ancient Mayans used cenotes (sinkholes) to obtain their water because there were no rivers in the area. These cenotes were divine to the Mayans since they were vital to the survival of the area's inhabitants. Currently, there are about 10,000 unregistered and 5,000 registered by the
government (Woodman, 2018).</li>
</ul>

 ## What is the Mayan Train project?

The Mayan Train project proposes a railway system that connects cities, towns, and archaeological sites throughout the Yucatán Peninsula and southeast Mexico. It aims to improve access to the area, create jobs, and boost tourism and the economy.  However, the project will have a significant negative impact on the environment. 

## Why is the Mayan Train project an environmental disaster?
<ul>
     <li>It is splitting the jungle in half.</li><br>
     <li>It is side-stepping environmental safeguards.</li><br>
     <li>It poses a threat to at least 10 protected natural areas and many animals (Russell, 2022).</li><br>
     <li>It encourages assaults on human rights advocates (“UN Experts Urge Mexico to Rethink Tourist Train Project,” 2022).</li><br>
     <li>It has disregarded the worries expressed by people from indigenous communities (“UN Experts Urge Mexico to Rethink Tourist Train Project,” 2022).</li><br>
     <li>It will pollute the Sacactun Cave System, as it directly crosses over it. The Sacactun Cave System is the second-longest network of underwater caves in the world and Mexico's largest
freshwater aquifer (Russell, 2022).</li><br>
</ul>

## Below are my key learnings from this project:
  <ul>
    <li> During this project, I encountered many obstacles. It was challenging to find verified information from the government, so I had to search for verified data uploaded by non-profit organizations. </li> <br>
    <li> In light of the challenges faced during this project, it became clear just how important data transparency is. The difficulty in finding verified information from the government highlighted the need for companies and the government to be more transparent with their data. Reliable and trustworthy information must be made more accessible, especially when dealing with issues as serious as ecocide and the destruction of important ecosystems. By prioritizing data transparency, we can better protect and preserve our natural resources for future generations, and prevent further damage to our planet.</li> <br>
    <li> What I hope readers and tourists get from this data is an understanding of the magnitude of the ecocide that the Mayan Train project has caused and will cause to the peninsula, the Indigenous communities, and the biodiversity that are and will be affected in the long run by it.
</li> <br>
  </ul>
